## Step 1

Runbook steps are defined by second-level headings. Text following a second-level heading, like this, describes and contains information about a runbook step.

Click on **Add action** above to insert a URL pointing to an action. These are just Markdown links, but are rendered as buttons inside Slack, and when clicked, will run the action.

You can use `Markdown` *formatting* and [the usual syntax](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet), but be aware some formatting and some Markdown features, including tables, images, and inline HTML, won't be displayed when viewing a runbook inside Slack.
